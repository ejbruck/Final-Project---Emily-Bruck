<p> Gun violence and shootings are a widespread threat in the modern United States. With access to firearms loosely controlled, and political debates concerning the second amendment flooding the media, it is evident that the issue is far from agreed upon.</p>
<p> Although according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/school-shootings-shootings-north-america-us-news-ap-top-news-8660507c56b04dd0b580b248d39d2a2c"> AP News </a> mass shootings are more present in small-town America as opposed to cities, NYC still has significant data pinpointing shooting occurrences in all five boroughs: New York County (Manhattan), Bronx County, Queens County, Kings County (Brooklyn), and Richmond County (Staten Island). </p>

<p> Data derived from the New York Police Department (NYPD) catalogs shootings incidents in 2022 from the beginning of the year to September, specifying both the perpetrator and victim’s gender, race, and age. The data also includes which NYC Borough any shooting occurred within. </p>

<p> After careful analysis of the data, notable conclusions can be drawn regarding New York City and its battle with gun violence. Among these conclusions are explanations about which Borough has the most shootings per capita, as well as which racial groups seem to be the most targeted in NYC as a whole. Additionally, outside perspectives of experts are able to provide background and context to the issue. </p>

<p> Bronx County has the highest rate of shootings per capita out of the five boroughs, with 30 shooting victims per 100,000 people. New York County (Manhattan)’s per capita rate is half of the Bronx, with 15 shootings per 100,000 people. </p>

<p> Queens County and Richmond County (Staten Island) maintain the lowest rates of gun violence, with nine and seven (respectively) per 100,000 people. </p>

<p> Per capita data of shooting per data can be visualized in the data chart below. </p>

<p> Ari Feldman, a digital journalist at New York 1 has experience with similar data sets that explore shooting occurrences in the boroughs and within each precinct. </p>

<p> He is able to provide background and reasoning for the per capita rates of shootings in the boroughs. His findings also found the Bronx to have the highest rate of shootings. There are many notable reasons for these statistics. </p>

<p> “If you look at data produced by the Bronx over a period of decades, the Bronx routinely ranks worst in a lot of different kinds of indices,” says Feldman, “from a public health perspective, it is the last of pretty much every county in the state, and it’s also a place with a high level of incarceration per capita.” </p>

<p> In other words, there are reasons for these disparities in shooting data that provide an explanation for why the Bronx would have the highest number of shootings even despite its comparably small population (to the other boroughs). Feldman pinpoints one of the most major issues in the Bronx as being high poverty, and explains that in his experience, violence seems to follow poverty. </p>


<p> “What I’ve learned from talking to experts over the years is that in NYC and in general violence is associated with poverty, and that the Bronx is a poor borough that has seen chronic lack of investment, especially in the South Bronx,” says Feldman. </p>

<p> The culmination of public health issues, infant mortality, life expectancy issues, incarceration, poverty, and gang violence has led the Bronx to where it is now in terms of violence. Not only this, but as Feldman highlights, the city has not done much to help. </p>

<p> “The city has not produced a real answer to ending this cycle… especially in the Bronx,” says Feldman. </p>

<p> Feldman gives a historical context to the borough as well, pinpointing the moment the borough began to face issues. In the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, white communities began to flee the Bronx neighborhoods, causing property values to drop. Soon after was the era of ‘the Bronx is burning’, a time of widespread fires, which created a reputation for the borough. </p>

<p> Feldman believes that whether the Bronx stays the way it is now is up to the city. Efforts such as investments upstream in education, housing, and food stability could make a real difference in the area, rather than what Feldman calls the usual “last ditch effort investing in more law enforcement.”</p>

<p> During his research and analysis, Feldman found significance in the overall jump in shooting violence in the city in 2020. Up until that point, there had been a drop in violence in the city, until the COVID-19 pandemic hit. </p>

<p> The Brooklyn borough was able to reverse this upward trend by 2021. But what Feldman saw in his data is that the increase of shootings in the Bronx continued to persist. This gives insight into other factors that played into the Bronx’s inability to bounce back like other boroughs did. </p>

<p> The NYPD data analyzed demonstrates a small portion of a larger issue: gun control. Feldman emphasized that now more than ever, NYPD precincts are finding significant numbers of guns per day. Gun manufacturers are producing and offloading guns into the city at a quick rate. This is just one issue that with resolution, could help curve the gun violence in NYC. </p>

<p> “Federal gun legislation would have a pretty significant impact on violence in NYC,” Feldman says, “but as of right now there is not going to be an end to the flow of guns into New York City.” </p>

<p> Alongside the significant findings comparing each borough, this data gives insight to the racial makeup of shooting victims. The same NYPD data from 2022 shows that black people make up the majority of shooting victims recorded in all of NYC. </p>

<p>With 1400 shootings recorded, about 66% of the total (76% including black hispanics) were black victims. The data chart below creates a visualization of these racial breakups. </p>

<p> It is evident that New York City and its law enforcement have a long way to go before the gun violence issue is resolved. With a sudden increase in gun violence in 2020, and boroughs like the Bronx who have yet to see a resolution since then, there are significant changes that need to be made. As Feldman emphasized, it is up to the city to propose and implement legislation that will make the changes the city needs. </p>
